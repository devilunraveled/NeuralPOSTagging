\section*{Conclusion}

The detailed examination of the top-performing models provides insights into the impact of hyperparameters on model performance, highlighting the importance of careful selection and tuning to achieve optimal results. Furthermore, the comparative analysis between FFNN and RNN architectures sheds light on their respective strengths and weaknesses in tackling the POS tagging task.

Moving forward, further exploration could involve experimenting with additional architectural variations, exploring different training strategies, and investigating the generalizability of the models across diverse datasets and languages. Overall, the findings contribute to advancing the understanding of neural POS tagging methods and offer valuable insights for future research and practical applications in natural language processing.
