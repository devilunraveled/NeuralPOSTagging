\section*{Introduction}

This assignment revolves around the task of \verb|POS Tagging|, that is, \textit{Part of Speech Tagging}.

The end-goal of the task is to take a given sentence, and assign, to each token, it's corresponding POS tag. To do so, I have used the data from the Universal Dependencies Dataset's \verb|en-atis| dataset. 

To perform the task, I have employed two broad approaches, using \textit{Feed Forward Neural Network}, \verb|FFNN| and \textit{Recurrent Neural Networks}, \verb|RNN|.
